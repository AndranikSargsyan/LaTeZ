This paper investigates the extensive role of YSU in fostering academic excellence and driving socio-economic development in Armenia. Employing a multi-dimensional research approach that integrates both qualitative and quantitative methods, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of YSU’s impact across educational, cultural, and economic spheres.

Through the collection of quantitative data—including graduation rates, employment outcomes, and research output—and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with faculty, students, alumni, local government officials, and business leaders, we delve into how YSU shapes its educational landscape and influences the broader economy. The educational impact analysis highlights significant advancements in student performance metrics, directly correlating with enhanced academic programs and support structures at YSU.

The study concludes that Yerevan State University is a cornerstone of Armenian education and development, with its influence extending beyond the confines of academia into the realms of societal enrichment and economic resilience. This paper aims to provide stakeholders in education and policy-making with valuable insights into the strategic role of higher education institutions in national development.
